# Emaildb

Emaildb uses a postgres database as a queue for (-probably- *in theory* transactional ðŸ˜‰) emails,
so, if you rollback a transaction, you don't send any e-mail!

Use `$ sqitch deploy` to deploy the necessary tables on your database.

Insert on `public.emaildb_config` to your needs.

When an insert occurs on `emaildb_queue` this service will send it.

# Starting this service

a

    perl script/process-emails.pl

b
    ./script/process-emails start

c

    # TODO
    docker run emaildb....
